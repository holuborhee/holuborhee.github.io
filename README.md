👨🏽‍💻 Welcome to My Developer Portfolio
=========================================

Hi there! I'm **John Olubori David**, a **Senior Full Stack Software Engineer** and **Software Architect** with **9+ years of experience** building scalable systems, leading engineering teams, and architecting robust solutions across multiple industries and continents.

I’m a **JavaScript expert** and a product-first engineer, passionate about solving real problems with clean code and thoughtful design. My work spans across **JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js, NestJS, Ruby on Rails, Python, PHP/Laravel, SQL, Docker**, and more.

🧑🏽‍💼 Executive Summary
-------------------------

*   🛠️ **Architected high-scale platforms** for startups and growing businesses, transforming monoliths into distributed systems.
    
*   🚀 **Led cross-functional teams** of engineers, designers, and product managers to deliver fast, iterative improvements.
    
*   💡 **Customer-centric mindset** with a strong emphasis on solving real-world problems with usable, elegant software.
    
*   🔁 **DevOps + CI/CD savvy**, ensuring clean, repeatable, and automated deployments with Docker, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions.
    
*   💾 **Database expert** with deep knowledge of RDBMS like PostgreSQL and MySQL, including ORM tools like Prisma, Knex, and TypeORM.
    

🚀 Current Work: Adventlabs (Technical Lead)
--------------------------------------------

As the **Chief Architect & Technical Lead** at **Adventlabs**, I lead the development of three B2B and B2C products from idea to launch:

*   **[Buzthrive](https://buzthrive.com/)** – Inventory & sales management for local SMEs. I designed the core data models and backend using **NestJS + PostgreSQL**, with real-time updates and analytics.
    
*   **[SME Suites](https://www.smesuites.com/)** – Lightweight business productivity tools (finance, HR, ops). Built the authentication, user onboarding, and subscription flow.
    
*   **[Articean](https://www.articean.com/)** – A platform connecting offline artisans to clients. Led the end-to-end architecture and integrated **Flutterwave for payments**.
    

> I built these products with **customer empathy**, frequent iteration, and architecture that allows scale without bottlenecks.

🧱 Highlight: Bloverse (2019–2021)
----------------------------------

At **Bloverse**, I redefined the entire engineering backbone:

*   🎯 **Challenge**: Monolithic system that couldn’t scale with increasing user demands.
    
*   🔧 **Solution**: Migrated to **microservices** using **Docker, Kubernetes, and Kafka**.
    
*   ⚙️ **Results**:
    
    *   Reduced downtime and crash frequency by 80%
        
    *   Deployed CI/CD via **Jenkins + GitHub Actions**
        
    *   Enabled faster releases and empowered team autonomy
        
*   🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏽 Mentored junior engineers and defined coding standards and service boundaries.
